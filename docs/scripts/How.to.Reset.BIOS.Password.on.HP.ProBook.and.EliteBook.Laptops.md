Fortunately, there are some ways to reset your BIOS password without having to replace your system board or contact HP support. In this article, we will show you how to use a utility called HPBR (HP BIOS Password Reset) to remove the BIOS password on your HP laptop.
  
## What is HPBR?
  
HPBR is a utility created by a user named Mazzif on the HP Support Community forum. It is designed to reset the BIOS password on HP Business Notebook, Desktop, and Workstation PCs. It works by creating a bootable USB flash drive or hard disk drive that contains a customized SMC.bin file that can override the BIOS password.
  
The utility is not endorsed by HP, and it may not work on all models or BIOS versions. Use it at your own risk and make sure you back up your data before attempting to reset your BIOS password.
  
## How to use HPBR?
  
To use HPBR, you will need a USB flash drive or hard disk drive with at least 4 GB of free space, another computer that can access the internet and run the utility, and your locked HP laptop.
  
Follow these steps to use HPBR:
  
1. Download the HPBR files from this link: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zu4kdgxm052l87d/AAAMi-kfX4AVH8oTCbsOM4X9a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zu4kdgxm052l87d/AAAMi-kfX4AVH8oTCbsOM4X9a?dl=0)
